The Grapple Interaction Toolkit provides functionality to create interactive experiences in Unity. The main features of
the Grapple IT package are:

- An interactable system, with a base class to inherit from and multiple implementations.
- Teleport functionality, to traverse the world with.
- Mesh baking functionality.
- 3D math functions.
- Gizmo extension to generate 3D shapes in the scene view.

To install the Grapple 2.0 Interaction Toolkit, go to the corresponding OpenUPM page and install it from there. If Grapple 2.0 Core has not yet been configured, do so as explained in the documentation.
