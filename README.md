# Grapple 2.0
Grapple is an open source, hand tracking framework for Unity. It is designed
to create hand tracking VR applications that can be easily ported to different platforms. Grapple consists of the
Grapple Core and Grapple Interaction Toolkit.

The documentation for the entire Grapple 2.0 framework can be found [here](https://rhinox-training.github.io/grpl-2.0/).

## Grapple Core
Within the Core package, the core fundamentals of a hand tracking application and some utilities are implemented. These
are:
- Joint system

## Grapple Samples
Within the Grapple sample package are 2 scenes.

- GRPLDemo, this scene uses all the system available in the Grapple Interaction Toolkit to showcase how they can be used.
- GRPLGestureTester, this scene gives you the finger bending values and current gesture each hand is making. This is really useful for testing and tweaking new or existing gestures.
