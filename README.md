## Grapple Samples
Within the Grapple sample package are 2 scenes.

- GRPLDemo, this scene uses all the system available in the Grapple Interaction Toolkit to showcase how they can be used.
- GRPLGestureTester, this scene gives you the finger bending values and current gesture each hand is making. This is really useful for testing and tweaking new or existing gestures.


The samples can be imported from the Unity package manager, after the Interaction toolkit is installed.
