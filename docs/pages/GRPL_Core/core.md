5. Open the OpenXR submenu and set the correct interaction profile for your target architecture and enable the *Hand Tracking Subsystem* feature group.
6. If developing for Oculus: also enable the *Meta* feature groups.

# Scene setup
There is one necessary GameObject to have in each hand-tracking XR scene in your app: an **XR Origin**.
The XR Origin GameObject enables device tracking and transforms trackables into Unity's coordinate system. If this GameObject is not present in the scene, XR will not function properly.
To create the XR origin, select **GameObject -> XR -> XR Origin**

On the **XR Origin** GameObject, add the **GRPL Joint Manager** and **GRPL Hand Visualizer**.

In the **GRPL Hand Visualizer** component, set the left and right hand prefab to the provided prefabs in **Grapple2.0 -> Prefabs -> Models**. Set the Hand Material to the provided DefaultHandsMaterial that can be found in Grapple2.0 -> Prefabs -> Materials.

All thatâ€™s left is to link your VR device (that supports hand tracking) and press play mode, then your hand should get tracked and visualized.
