# Gesture Tester and Finger Bending Visualizer

![GestureTester](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76707656/233690897-f3e86351-0a10-429c-8d4b-3497433e016b.PNG)

## Description

This scene is just to test out gestures and see both the raw and re-mapped finder bend values.
This is less of a demo scene and more of a testing ground.

You can make a certain gesture with your hand, record it into the list of gestures and tweak its values all at runtime.
To know more about how a [**RhinoxGesture**](https://rhinox-training.github.io/grpl-2.0/pages/GRPL_Core/rhinoxxrgrapple-RhinoxGesture.html) or how the [**Gesture Recognition system**](https://rhinox-training.github.io/grpl-2.0/pages/GRPL_Core/rhinoxxrgrapple-GRPLGestureRecognizer.html) works in general, click the high lighted words.

To change the remapped values. Go to the [**Jointmanager**](https://rhinox-training.github.io/grpl-2.0/pages/GRPL_Core/rhinoxxrgrapple-GRPLJointManager.html) on the Grapple_Player rig and and there you can change the threshold values to your own liking.
